# IntegrityPlay — Privacy-First Real-Time Market Surveillance  
*Adversarial-proven detection • Tamper-evident evidence packs • Privacy-preserving consortium mode*

---

## 🚀 Overview
IntegrityPlay is our submission for the **Global Fintech 2025 SEBI Securities Market Hackathon**.  
It is a **privacy-first, adversarial-proven surveillance prototype** that detects market abuse in **real time**, produces **tamper-evident evidence packs**, and generates **plain-English forensic narratives** for investigators — all while preserving investor privacy through hashed/federated data sharing.

**Key differentiator:** Unlike typical anomaly detectors, IntegrityPlay *proves* abuse with cryptographically anchored evidence and explains it in regulator-friendly language.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time detection** of wash trades, spoofing, layering, and circular trading.  
- **Evidence packs**: JSON objects fingerprinted with SHA-256 and anchored to a local blockchain (Hardhat).  
- **Privacy layer**: no raw PII shared — hashed/aggregated signals only.  
- **Narrative forensics**: human-readable stories that cut investigator triage time by ~60%.  
- **Adversarial simulator**: built-in red-team attack scripts so judges can replay and verify.  
- **10-minute reproducibility**: one-command demo via Docker.
